# MEGA-MLP
MEGA Machine Learning Project

This scope of this project includes:
  1: Porting of various sparse learning methods from the SLEP software package into the MLPack framework.
  2: Extraction/transformation of data in common bioinformatic formats to inputs suitable for ported MLPack functions.
  3: Higher order, phylogenetically-based analysis and processing of multiple outputs from MLPack functions to generate/test phylogenetic hypotheses.

Ideally, work is partitioned so that the statistical building blocks created in scope (1) are a conceptually separate deliverable from the set of bioinformatic ETL operations created in scope (2) and the biological analysis methods created in scope (3).

(1) necessarily needs to be written in c++, (2) and (3) can be written in whatever language is convenient for integration with MEGA, performance considerations notwithstanding.
