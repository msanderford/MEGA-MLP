# MEGA-MLP
MEGA Machine Learning Project

The scope of this project includes:
1. Porting of various sparse learning methods from the SLEP software package into the MLPack framework.
2. Extraction/transformation of data in common bioinformatic formats to inputs suitable for ported MLPack functions.
3. Higher order, phylogenetically-based analysis and processing of multiple outputs from MLPack functions to generate/test phylogenetic hypotheses.

Ideally, work is partitioned so that the statistical building blocks proposed in scope (1) are a conceptually separate deliverable from the set of bioinformatic ETL operations proposed in scope (2) and the biological analysis methods proposed in scope (3).

(1) necessarily needs to be written in c++, (2) and (3) can be written in whatever language is convenient for integration with MEGA, performance considerations notwithstanding.
